üóìÔ∏è June 6, 2025 ‚Äì Sprint #1 ‚Äì Core Simulator Engine
‚úÖ What Was Completed
‚Ä¢ Built initial financial simulator with user input
‚Ä¢ Added growth rate and user count logic
‚Ä¢ Connected four revenue channels: ID Verification, Subscriptions, Affiliates, Landlords (consolidated in totalRevenue)
‚Ä¢ Displayed revenue and user metrics for Month 1, Month 60, and cumulative

üõ†Ô∏è Technical Details
‚Ä¢ Simulator coded in vanilla JS + HTML
‚Ä¢ Revenue logic fully driven by user count and phased monetisation
‚Ä¢ Handled affiliate percentage growth shift after Month 18
‚Ä¢ Added toggle for data view (monthly/cumulative)

üí≠ Reasoning & Notes
‚Ä¢ This sprint focused on validating the simulation engine against our FS Model
‚Ä¢ Accuracy was checked against model screenshots and founder expectations
‚Ä¢ Ensured code is clean, understandable, and ready for scaling in Sprint 2

üìà Next Steps
‚Ä¢ Add salary cost logic and EBITDA tracking
‚Ä¢ Enable Predicted vs Actual toggle with input override
‚Ä¢ Begin runway, gross margin, and LTV/CAC tracking

‚úÖ Sprint 2 ‚Äì Revenue & Cost Engine
Date: June 6, 2025
Status: ‚úÖ Completed
Lead: Kris Ericsson
Sprint Type: Functional + UI
Files Affected: script.js, index.html, style.css

üîß What Was Built
‚Ä¢ Salary Engine: Foundational logic added to calculate dynamic salary costs per employee across 60 months.
‚Ä¢ NI + Pension Contributions: Employer National Insurance (15%) and Pension (3%) accurately calculated and applied.
‚Ä¢ Founders as Initial Roles: Only Kris & Matt are included in the cost logic by default ‚Äî all other roles can be added in future sprints.
‚Ä¢ Monthly EBITDA: Now calculated live by subtracting salary + contributions from total revenue.
‚Ä¢ Total Cost Breakdown: Backend logic in place, front-end visualisation deferred to Sprint 3.

üß™ Notes
‚Ä¢ Actual OPEX (e.g., marketing, rent, SaaS, accounting) implemented in Sprint 3.
‚Ä¢ Visual layout improved but styling refinements handled in Sprint 6.
